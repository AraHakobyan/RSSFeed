# RSSFeed

1. Create an application that should display a feed from RSS data.

2. Use the news.am RSS feed or any other RSS source as data.

3. You have to save the RSS data in a local database (for example in a room)

4. Create a list on the screen with saved RSS data (no need to open a detailed screen for each item)

5. The application should receive new data every constant minute.

6. The application must have a toggle button to allow the user to see the dummy data(mocked data which is not from real RSS).
